# MUM - Mailserver User Management

### Ô∏èÔ∏è‚ö†Ô∏è ATTENTION üß®
This software is still in development and not production-ready. Help us make it 
better by contributing!

### Documentation
The up-to-date version of the documentation is hosted 
[right here](https://mum-project.github.io/).
The [docs repository](https://github.com/mum-project/docs) is tagged using MUM's
version numbers, so you may access older documentation simply by downloading the
corresponding documentation version and building the static site yourself.

### About the Project
Since there weren't any good web-based user management tools for Postfix and 
Dovecot out there, we decided to build our own. MUM originated as a software 
development project at 
[Stuttgart Media University](https://www.hdm-stuttgart.de).

### Migration
Coming from another mailbox administration software? Maybe you want to have a 
look at [MUM Migrator](https://github.com/mum-project/migrator/). Our console 
migration tool moves your data in a matter of minutes and allows you to focus on
the important things.

### Contributing
You want to help? Awesome! Have a look at the 
[Contribution Guide](CONTRIBUTING.md) and start coding.

### Security
