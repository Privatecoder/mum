# MUM

> This software is still in development and not production-ready. Help us make it better by contributing!

## Documentation
The up-to-date version of the documentation is hosted [right here](https://mum-project.github.io/docs/).
The [docs repository](https://github.com/mum-project/docs) is tagged using MUM's version numbers, so you
may access older documentation simply by downloading the corresponding documentation version and building
the static site yourself.

## About the Project
MUM originated as a software development project at [Stuttgart Media University](https://www.hdm-stuttgart.de).
Since there weren't any good web-based user management tools for Postfix and Dovecot out there, we decided
to build our own.

## Contributing
You want to help? Awesome! Have a look at the [Contribution Guide](CONTRIBUTING.md) and start coding.
